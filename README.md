LOG_CAP_VOL Unit hyperspherical cap volume
----
    Compute the log-volume of a height-d_h, radius-d_r cap on the unit ball in n_dim dimensions.
 
    Input: n_dim = dimension, natural number
           d_r = radius of ball
           d_h = cap height, in [0,d_r]
    Output: d_log_vol = log(volume of cap)
